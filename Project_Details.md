# Instructions
In groups of 5-6 individuals, select a scenario as a team and create and utilize services, with a final demonstration of workflow and services created, and ensuring to delete resources. All scenarios are graded out of a score of 75 marks. Any code generated, datasets, should be uploaded onto the team GitHub page. The screenshots and document explaining the reasoning and setting utilized will be uploaded to Brightspace. The regions selected should be East-US and select the cheapest development option.

## Scenario #1:

In azure, deploy virtual machines(select the cheapest options) then manage them using the respective platform's management tools. Students must then create an Azure Function app and configure it to use a database (e.g., Cosmos DB).Then, implement a RESTful API using Azure Functions to interact with the database. Implement an authentication mechanism for the API using Azure Active Directory (AAD) and OAuth 2.0. Finally, deploy the Azure Function app and test the API using a tool like Postman. The students will be evaluated on their ability to configure, secure, and optimize the virtual machines, azure functions, and databases. Following correct security protocols and best practices.
